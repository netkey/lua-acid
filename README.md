#   Name

lua-acid

#   Status

This library is in beta phase.

It is deployed in a production envinroment and has been running stably.
But it still requires more tests and docs.

#   Description

lua-acid is a colleciton of lua utility functions and a classic paxos
implementation.

It is meant to be a underlaying code base for building a distributed system.

# Test

This package needs perl command `prove` to run unittest:

```
$ sudo cpan Test::Nginx

# optional, setup nginx path:
$ export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/Cellar/openresty/1.11.2.3/nginx/sbin

# test all
$ prove
```


# lua-poxos

Classic Paxos implementation in lua.

Nginx cluster management based on paxos.

Feature:

-   Classic two phase paxos algorithm.

-   Optional phase-3 as phase 'learn' or 'commit'

-   Support membership changing on the fly.

    This is archived by making the group members a paxos instance. Running paxos
    on group member updates group membership.

    Here we borrowed the concept 'view' that stands for a single version of
    membership.

    'view' is a no more than a normal paxos instance.
